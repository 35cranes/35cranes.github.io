      <description>&lt;p&gt;March 11, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Echo,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s my second day in vilnius, lithuania. i took a walk to the republic of uzupis, where used to built by a hippies group, as they said. it looks pretty commercialized nowadays already, but i was still into the small rivers alongside. this afternoon i was sitting by the sound and the pattern of those tiny ripples, almost tearing out. i remember you were not interesting in water, wasn&amp;rsquo;t it? but i believe you&amp;rsquo;d still like some part of it. so far the city is vivid in my sights - not stark at all like some ppl said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
