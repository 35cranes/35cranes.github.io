      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mundus-est-fabula-the-world-is-a-fiction&#34;&gt;Mundus Est Fabula (the world is a fiction)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because Bloom is he who can no longer separate himself from the immediate context containing him, his gaze is that of a man &lt;em&gt;that does not identify&lt;/em&gt;. Everything blurs under the Bloom effect and is lost in the inconsequential wavering of objective relationships where life is felt negatively, in indifference, impersonality, and the lack of quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bloom lives inside of Bloom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spread out all around us is a petrified world, a world of &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; where we ourselves, with our “I,” our gestures, and even our feelings figure in as things. Nothing can belong to us as truly our own in such a landscape of death. We are more and more like exiles, never sure of understanding what’s happening all around.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
